Description: Implements the One Rule (OneR) Machine Learning classification algorithm (Holte, R.C. (1993) <doi:10.1023/A:1022631118932>) with enhancements for sophisticated handling of numeric data and missing values together with extensive diagnostic functions. It is useful as a baseline for machine learning models and the rules are often helpful heuristics.
