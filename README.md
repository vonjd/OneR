# OneR
This R package implements the One Rule (OneR) Machine Learning classification algorithm with enhancements for sophisticated handling of numeric data and missing values together with extensive diagnostic functions. It is useful as a baseline for machine learning models and the rules are often helpful heuristics.

## Documentation

This video gives a step-by-step introduction: [Quick Start Guide for the OneR package](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGC0oRlXxgU)

You can find the vignette and full documentation in the package and on CRAN: [OneR: One Rule Machine Learning Classification Algorithm with Enhancements](https://cran.r-project.org/package=OneR)
